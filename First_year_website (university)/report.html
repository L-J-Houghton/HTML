<h3 id="report_sh">Luke Houghton</h3>
<a href="http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~lhoug001/webprog/cw5/index.html"><h3>(Live view link to my site) http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~lhoug001/webprog/cw5/index.html</h3></a>
<h3 id="Intro">Intro:</h3>
<p>This is the report html for cw5 which documents and explains exactly what techniques 
   and methods I have used to achieve the styles , intereaction and the content within the
   site itself all images and font files taht are used within this site are free for non-commercial use and for modification. I 
   have ensured this by only using a creative commons search and also using google search filters to ensure the images are free to use and 
   modify as I wish. The font type is "Timeburner" which I have downloaded from fontspace.com are also marked free to use for commercial purposes
   by the author themselves. And all Javascript and css files have been minified and compressed. 
   <br/>
   I will be explaining and disecting every element within each of the pages used within my
   and shall explain:</p>
   <ol>
   <li>What I have done to achieve this.</li>
   <li>Why I have done this and the inspiration behind this.</li>
   <li>What Resources or references I have used to help to achieve the end product.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>I have also attached a references text file that includes the references for mainly the
      creative commons images I have used within the site and any code references I have used.
   </p>
   <h3 id="site_h">The site:</h3>
   <h4 id="mq">Media Queries:</h4>
   <p>I have done media queries for both a standard mobile devices both portrait and landscape and also a media query for 
      desktop and laptop versions. For the media query for the mobile site I have not included the background as I wanted
	  to simplify and expand the site as much as possible for mobile devices therefore I have not included the background image for
	  both simplicity and the functionality of the site. I have used google developer tools to develop and design the site for mobile
	  devices and I have been using my 15" laptop 1366x768 resolution to design the site however I have made a media query for devices
	  with a minimum width of 1224px resolution as this his widely used for desktop and many laptop devices. I have tested the site in chrome,
	  safari for mobile query , IE10 and firefox to ensure it works across multiple browsers. I was originally planning to use a different navigation menu 
	  for the mobile media query but the "Hamburger navigation bar" as it is more commonly known does would have accesibility issues. I therefore have 
	  increased the font-size of the nav bar text and repositioned the bar. I have also created bigger buttons and bigger icon butons such as within the
	  social media bar for mobile the mobile media query as this would make it easier to view and interact with the site.</p>
   <h4 id="layout">Layout of the site:</h4>
   <p>For the layout and styling of the site I took inspiration from a few sites that use a minimilistic approach to style. I also wanted to make the 
      page centre aligned with the font left aligned within it so the layout style that I have created also allows for this to happen aswell. I have also used a 
	  background image for all desktop queries for the site as the grey background image compliments the colour scheme and the overall aesthetical appearance
	  of the site. I have surrounded the main content of the site in a div tag called site, I have done this to create a centred page effect that is simplistic
	  and stylish. I got the idea for this from a few sites however I at first did not know how to achieve the effect so I researched and by looking at a few 
	  forums I developed an understanding of how to achieve the desired end result. In terms of the layout of the html I have done everything apart from the 
	  doctype declaration which I had gotten the template from the W3 schools site. I have also used GIMP editor to compress the images to save file
	  space and to also load the pages faster and smoother.</p>
   <h3 id="index_h">Index.html</h3>
   <div id="index.html">
     <p>In this page I have created a simple yet stylish design that is sleek and easy on the eye.
	    I have created a navigation bar , a Jquery slider, twitter feed, small info article, 
		rollover social media bar and footer with a simple grey background.
		I have created this page as a homepage that helps the user to see exactly what content
		the site consists of and some social media features such as a twitter feed.</p>
		<p>
		 
		
		</p>
   </div>
   <h4 id="nav">The nav bar:</h4>
   <img id="nav_bar" src="images\nav_bar.png"/>
   <h4 id="what_1">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
   <p id="nav_what">In order to help the user navigate through the site easily and harmoniously
   and also makes the site more accessible for disabled/impaired users'. The navigation bar also
   is widely used within most of the web in modern times and it is what the average user has been 
   acustomed to. To achieve this result I have used the html5 nav tags and within those tags I have 
   created an un ordered list which within those tags I have used the list elements to create the
   menu options such as music , cv etc. I have then surrounded these with anchor tags to allow the 
   menu options to become interactive and thus allowing the user to visit the rest of the site 
   content. In order to achieve the visual effects such as the background and the box-shadowing
   I have used css3. First I have positioned the list in place and then I used the display-inline
   method inbuilt within css3 to display the list horizontally. I have then used the on hover method 
   within css3 to change the colour of the background once the user is hovering over the menu option
   (list element) itself I have also changed the background to a blue colour to fot the colour scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I have also applied a box shadow effect on hover aswell as this creates a visually appealing
   effect and also fits in with the sleek design of the website. I have also used the rgba extension on the
   box shadow to create a more accurate visual effect. I have also included an image within the nav bar as
   this is the logo for the site that I made using the GIMP editor and also importing "timeburner" which is
   a free to use commercial font whcih I have also applied across the nav bar and the website to keep it unified
   and formal.</p>
   <h4 id="why_1">Why I have I done this:</h4>
   <p id="nav_why">I have made the navbar to help the user navigate their way through the site with ease and
   simplicity. I have also done this as it is the design and layout for many other sites and therefore it is 
   what users' are custom to and therefore I have designed a navigation bar with the client (user) in mind.
   I have also done this for style and effect as the navbar gives the site a proffesional and sleek design
   which i what I was aiming for as this is also visually and aesthetically appealing for the user aswell as it
   is useful. The navbar also compliments the rest of the site aswell and I have decided to keep it through out 
   all of the pages of the site as it is a useful feature and contributes to the aesthetical properties aswell.
   </p>
   <h4 id="other_1">Sources/references:</h4>
   <p>I have used the W3 schools site just to reference a few things and to view the structuring of the navbar
   just to remind myself and have used the insight what I got from viewing the W3 schools material online to 
   influence my own navbar design however all the coding I had done myself. I have also used the colour 
   picker within GIMP editor to get the hex value and the rgba values for the background colour(theme).</p>
   <h4 id="slider">The jQuery slider:</h4>
   <img id="slider_img" src="images\slider_img.png" />
   <h4 id="what_2">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
   <p id="slider_what">In order to achieve this result I have installed the jQuery plugin and have kept it as 
   a seperate file and then linked within the index.html I have then used artcile tags in which I made div tags
   which I then used later on within css and also to contain the rest of the elements and images within the slider
   itself. I have then created an un ordered list within the div tag and then within those I have created list elements
   which contain the images used within the slider. I have then went ahead in css and have set the height and width of 
   the images using the divs and also using css properites such as float left and absolute positioning to position the
   slider within the article itself. I have then used jQuery to create the slideshow animation I have done this by following a 
   youtube tutorial (see references) and then from the knowledge I gained I then knew how to structure and layout the jQuery
   script itself. I then coded the script myself and also set my own values such as the speed and the animation time /transition
   How the jQuery script works is by taking first setting the interval and then moving the margin-left along 100%. The jQuery calls the
   divs by id that are used in the css in order to carry out and create this end result. I have then set the timed values in milliseconds
   for accuracy and this also enables the slider to fucntion properly to change/animate the images within the slideshow at a smooth and 
   consistent pace. The slideshow jquery function also works by getting the current element (in this case the list element) by using the 
    "this" method which then allows the rest of the script to run and the animation to be carried out.</p>
	<h4 id="why_2">Why I have done this:</h4>
	<p id="slider_why">I have done this as it fits in with the stlye of the site and also compliments the site layout and design and to also 
	create an image gallery which relates to the page as London is somewhere very personal to me as it's where I grew up and therefore the images 
	have been used to coincide with the site itself. I have chosen to display the images in a slideshow as it's a very clean and presentable way 
	not to mention the style and visual effects and benefits it brings to the site by using it.</p>
	<h4 id="other_2">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>The online material I have used to reference and to gain the knowledge of the structuring and layout of the jQuery slideshow is:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJCWW2P_T0g I used this video just to gain an insight as to what the jQuery function looks like and
	to also gain an insight of the css structuring aswell. I have made my own slider from scratch and have altered the steps and the function
	that is originally shown in the video to tailor it to my own site. And have only used the online video tutorial as a reference guide.</p>
	<h4 id="twitter">Twitter feed:</h4>
	<img id="twitter_img" src="images\twitter_report.png" />
	<h4 id="what_3">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
	<p>In order to achieve this result I had done some research and found the twitter API widget on the twitter site and then generated
	my own twitter feed using their online tool. This then generated the javascript which I then took and put into a seperate js file.
	I have then linked this in to the index.html in the head of the html file and I have then created a div in which the anchor tag for the 
	twitter javascript is held. I have also contained the anchor tag / twitter feed within this div as I have used css3 to change the layout 
	properties and the aesthetcial properties of the widget (twitter feed) to make it tailored to my site. I have used the twitter widget tool
	which is widely used to create the widget and have used the twitter widget instructions on the twitter site to generate the code needed in order
	for the function to run and the feed to be displayed. In order to keep the files seperate I have linked in another javascript file which uses a
	jquery onload function which then allows the twitter feed javascript to be loaded once the page has sucessfully loaded. </p>
	<h4 id="why_3">Why I have done this:</h4>
    <p id="twitter_why">
	I have made the twitter feed as it links back to the idea of the nav bar and that is mainly due down to the way in which most users' are
	acustomed to. Therefore the twitter feed is a nice touch which also has some meaning behind it and that is to keep users' in touch with
	the latest news and information. The account I created was an example account as I do not use twitter myself. The twitter feed also fits
	in with the modern design and I have also used css3 properties in order to manipulate and position the twitter feed to fit within the design
	aswell.</p>
	<h4 id="other_3">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>I have used this link https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public to find out more information and to gain an understanding as to what
	steps required in order to create a twitter feed. I have also used the twitter feed widget generator to generate the function : https://dev.twitter.com/web/javascript
    To generate the code I simply signed into my account and then followed the instructions and steps required to generate the code using my account settings
	within twitter. I have also used W3 schools just to refer to the jQuery onload function that I had created.</p>
	<h4 id="smb">Social media bar:</h4>
	<img id="smb_img" src="images\smb.png" />
    <h4 id="what_4">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
    <p>I have first downloaded the images online using a creative commons search image first to ensure the images are free to use and to modify. I then
	used GIMP editor to modify the images to greyscale as this would be needed in order to create a javascript rollover button effect. I then created a div
	which then contains the images. Within each img element I also added anchor tags in order to ensure the buttons were also interactive when clicked and
	linked to the correct sites such as facebook , twitter etc. I then ensured that the images had id's as this would be needed in order to generate the rollover
	animation using javascript. I then generated the js file which then consists of a function which takes the id of the image which the user's mouse is over
	using a mouseover fucntion which then passes through the image (id) and then changes the properties and thus changing the image file. Onmouse out fucntion is
	then used to then return the id to it's original image file. I have finally linked the js file into the head of the index.html to allow it to function within 
    the homepage / index.html</p>
	<h4 id="why_4">Why I have done this:</h4>
	<p>I have done this as I wanted to generate a social media type bar that allows the user to visit the site's social media profiles. I have not
	linked the buttons with my actual accounts for security purposes. However the buttons do link to the sites just to demonstrate that the social
	media bar actually works. I have also added a box shaow on each of the icons on hover as this creates and fits in with the style fo the site aswell.
	Making it more aesthetically pleasing and more interactive for the user which gives a better and enhanced user experience.</p>
	<h4 id="other_4">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>In order to do this I have used previous knowledge I have along with the reference pages on the W3 schools site.</p>
	<h4 id="info">Info area</h4>
	<img id="info_img" src="images\info.png" />
    <h4 id="what_4">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
	<p>I have created a small information area which tells the user about the site itself. It is essentially an introduction to the site. I have achieved this
	by surrounding the information in pargraph tags , then containing the paragraph within a div tag which is then contained in the article tags. I have 
	also used css to position and align the text as well as using the font-size property within css3 to set the font size.</p>
	<h4 id="why_4">Why I have done this:</h4>
	<p>I have done this as this info area gives more information about the site and gives a general overview as to what the site consists of. I have also positioned this
	at a certain position to keep a grid based design that relates to the overall sleek modern design of the whole site. Therefore the information area has css3 
	properties allowing it to be positioned accordingly and fit within the design / style of the site.</p>
	<h4 id="other_4">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>I have used the W3 schools site just to refer to some of the css3 properites that I have used in order to create this information area.</p>
	<h4 id="boxes">Box area</h4>
	<img id="boxes_img" src="images\boxes.png" />
	<h4 id="what_5">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
	<p>I have firstly created the images for the info boxes using GIMP editor and then I have created section tags within the html which contain the images.
	I have then added paragraph tags in which I have added information about the selected image within. I then went ahead using css3 and set the z-index of the 
	images to 1 as this puts the image in front of the paragraphs. I have also set the text opacity to 0 as this will be needed in order to create the jQuery animation 
	once the user clicks the tile(image). I have then using javascript / jQuery created a several functions that change the css properties of the images and the 
	paragraphs within the html. The function is very simple and on the users click the id (image) changes it's opacity to 0 and the paragraph opacity becomes 1 at a 
     slow pace therefore creating a subtle and simple animation that allows intereaction between the site and the user.</p>
	<h4 id="why_5">Why I have done this:</h4>
	<p>The reasoning behind this is simply to create a stylish animation and effect as if the text were just to be displayed on the screen it'd look slightly
	dull and there would be too much content which would make it not as aesthetically pleasing as it could be. I have also offered intereaction as the intereaction
	offers more communiation between the site and the end user. The tiles (image) animation is also used to keep the site compact in terms of visual spacing
	and also because it suits the sleek stlying of the rest fo the site.</p>
	<h4 id="other_5">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>I have used the W3 schools site just to refer to some of the jQuery animation functions such as fadeTo.</p>
	<h4 id="footer">Footer</h4>
	<img id="footer_img" src="images\footer.png" />
	<h4 id="what_6">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
	<p>In order to achieve this result I have used the html5 footer tags to create the footer element itself. I have then added
	   some footer text add some information to the footer. I have then used the footer tag within css3 to add colour and an inset gradient
	   which gives the footer a shadowed effect. To do this I have used the css3 background property to set the colour to the hex value that the 
	   rest of the site uses so that the footer is consistent with the colour theme of the site. I have then used the box-shadow property to then create an
	   inset within the footer to give it a gradient effect for style purposes.
	   </p>
	<h4 id="why_6">Why I have done this:</h4>
	<p>I have done this simply to add stlye to the site and to show the use of html5 tags. I have also done this to fit in with the style of
	the site and as footers have become an essential part of modern websites as they know when the websites content ends. I have chosen to use the 
	same colour as the rest of the site as it keeps the design simplified and minimalistic. </p>
	<h4 id="other_6">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>I have used W3 schools just as a reference to refer to some uses of the footer html5 tags.</p>
	<h3 id="About_h">About.html</h3>
     <p>In this page I have created a small bio about myself and have included some images that relate to the bio /blog itself. The page has a
	 simple layout that compliments the rest of the site and also is sleek yet minimalistic. The font used within this page as with all pages is Timebunrer
	 and the font colour is also the same hex colour as the rest of the site as I wanted to keep everything simple and unified when designing the site.
	 The page uses both navigation bar and the footer bar which have been explained in the index.html.</p>
	 <h4 id="about_article">Article</h4>
	 <img id="article_img" src="images\about_article.png" />
	 <h4 id="what_7">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
	 <p>In order to achieve this I have created a div within the html5 article tags in which I then have created a several paragraph
	 tags and within those tags I have included the text information that is shown to the user. I have also used css3 properties such as 
	 position and font-size in order to manipulate and to gain the desired result. The font type used is Timeburner as I wanted to keep all font
	 uniformal throughout the site as this contributes to the simplistic design.</p>
	 <h4 id="why_7">Why I have done this:</h4>
	 <p>I have done this to display information to the end user and to also add content to the site. I have also used the certain css3 properites
	 such as absolute positioning and font-size to display the information in a proffesional and organised way in which compliments the 
	 rest of the page and enhances the aesthetical appeal of the page just by positioning the text in a certain way. The text has also been 
	 left aligned as I wnated to keep a proffesional and simple style to the content within this page.</p>
	 <h4 id="other_7">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>I have used W3 schools just as a reference to refer to some uses of the absolute positioning.</p>
	<h4 id="about_aside">Aside</h4>
	<img id="aside_img" src="images\about_aside.png" />
	<h4 id="what_8">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
	<p>In order to achieve this result I have used the image tags within the html5 file and then within those I have inserted image tags
	and linked the file paths of those images within those image tags. I have then used css3 properties such as width and height to set the 
	images to a specific measurement so that they are in proportion to the page and therefore are aesthetically pleasing. I have also used absolute
	positioning to position the images and the aside tag itself so that the page has a stylish composition and is aesthetically appealing to the 
	user.</p>
	<h4 id="why_8">Why I have done this:</h4>
	<p>I have done this as I wanted to not only show visual information but also to add styling to the page with the use fo imagery. I have used 
	composition to layout the images alongside the text. I have also considered spacing between the text and images themselves ensuring
	that the content is not too cramped yet at the same time still keeping the grid based design of the page.</p>
	<h4 id="other_8">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>I have used W3 schools just as a reference to refer to some uses of the absolute positioning , height and width properties. (Image references - see end of report)</p>
	<h4 id="interests">Interests.html</h4>
	<img id="interest_img" src="images\interests.png" />
	<h4 id="what_9">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
	<p>In order to achieve the effects within this page I have used the nav bar and footer as shown in the index.html section of the 
	report. I have also used jQuery functions such as fadeTo and fadeOut to create simple yet effective animations that allow the user to interactive
	with the site and also enables me to enhance the aesthetical beauty of the site as infomration can be hidden until needed making the site
    layout more compact and effecient. How the jQuery works is very simple , it uses a click event handler which then once the action is complete
	this then runs the function allowing the tiles to fade away whilst the information fades in. I have also used css3 property effects such as 
	absolute positioning to align and position the images within the page effectively and to suit the sleek style of the rest of the site.
	I have also used the opacity attribute within css to allow the jQuery to function and carry out the desired animation.</p>
	<h4 id="why_9">Why I have done this:</h4>
	<p>I have done this to show the content of the site and to also generate a page that has been designed with composition and the user in mind. I have used
	jQuery to create the animations as there is less code and therefore the animations run more smoothly. I have also used jQuery to do this as the 
	fadeTo and fadeOut effects are a good way to create simple yet effective animations for the end user to interact with. The reasoning behind hiding the
	infomration until the tile is clicked is simply for design purposes and the visual / aesthetcial properties of the webpage as too much information
	on one page can confuse the user and by creating these simple animations and hiding the text and information is not only more aesthetically appealing
	but also is alot more clearer for the user to know what they're looking at.</p>
	<h4 id="other_9">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>I have used W3 schools just as a reference to refer to some uses of the jQuery animations ,absolute positioning , height and width properties. (Image references - see end of report)</p>
		<h4 id="music">music.html</h4>
	<img id="music_img" src="images\music.png" />
	<h4 id="what_10">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
	<p>In order to achieve this result I have used jQuery , css and html to create a music page which is essentially my playlist of some of my favourite
	   artists / songs. When clicked the user is taken to my playlist page on youtube where the playlist is set on auto play. I have used jQuery to change the 
	   opacity of the text once the image is hovered over. How the jQuery function works is relatively simple it uses a mouseover function which takes 
	   the element by it's id name and then performs the rest of the script allowing the text below to go to a fuller opacity once the user hovers over the 
	   image within the playlist. I have used css3 to create a box shadow effect and have changed the rgba values so that the box shadow is the same colour
	   as the site colour theme. In the html of the page I have first created article tags and within those article tags I have created divs which I have used
	   within css3 to manipulate and position images and text. I have also used these divs as containers for the text and for the images which I have also
	   surrounded in anchor tags allowing the user to visit the playlist page on youtube of the seleceted artist.</p>
	<h4 id="why_10">Why I have done this:</h4>
	<p>I have used the jQuery animations (functions) to create these effects as not only does it bring style and aesthetcial appeal to the site but it also
	   shows the user the artists name once they hover over the chosen image (artist) I have also chosen to do this as it allows more interaction between the 
	   user and the site therefore enhancing the user experience. I have chosen to use the box shadow technique within css3 as this not only is used for aesthetical
	   appearance purposes but is also used to inform the user of the selected artist (image) as the box shadow creates a highlighted/bold effect.
       I also have used css3 attributes such as height , width and absolute positioning to manipulate and design a gallery styled page that consists of both
	   text and images which are interactive.</p>
	<h4 id="other_10">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>I have used W3 schools just as a reference to refer to some uses of the jQuery animations ,absolute positioning , height and width properties and css3 hover
	   properites such as hover and box shadows (Image references - see end of report)</p>
	   		<h4 id="cv">cv.html</h4>
	<img id="cv_img" src="images\cv.png" />
	<h4 id="what_11">What I have done to achieve this result:</h4>
	<p>I have made a personal statement / cv page that contains a sample cv that I have made as an example. In order to create this I have used html5 tags 
	   such as artcile to create this page as I have created paragraphs within the article tags as the article tag acts as a container from which the 
	   paragraphs which form the article are placed. I have also used css3 to position and align the text so that it is presented in a proffesional manner
	   and coincides with the sites style. I have also used css3 to set the font to time burner aswell as setting the font to the blue colour which is seen
	   throughout the theme of the site.</p>
	<h4 id="why_11">Why I have done this:</h4>
	<p>I have used html5 and css in this way as I wanted to achieve the effect of a proffesionally designed page that fitted in with the sleek theme that 
	   runs throughout the site. I have also used article tags as they are a recognised html5 tag that can be used within both css and html5 allowing me to 
	   present infomration in a simple and proffesional manner. I have also chosen to use the timeburner fontstyle and the blue colour value within css
	   to keep the styling of the site unified and simplistic.</p>
	<h4 id="other_11">Sources/references:</h4>
	<p>I have only used the W3 schools reference pages to refer to specific css rules.</p>
