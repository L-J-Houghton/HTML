<p>
	I am an individual with a hard work ethic , a well rounded skillset and
	a wide range of enterprising skills. I have previously worked in the IT 
	industry and would like to prosper and pursue within the industry I have
	a high amount of passion for. I have always had a passion for technology 
	and since the age of 14 I have taught myself several programming languages
	through looking at online material and reading books and have developed 
	simple programs that I have used to test my programming and coding skills.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
	I have also worked with 3d visual graphics and have created 3d models
	and short basic test animations within Autodesk Maya and 3ds max. I was 
	inspired by Architecture of buildings and designed and rendered my own 
	concepts within multiple 3d design programs. I then used these 3d models
	along with my coding and programming skills to develop short demo games
	within the Unreal development kit (UDK). This then inspired me to look 
	into the app development market and particulary the gaming app market. 
	In which I had researched and constructed analytical data in order to 
	inspire ideas for future apps , websites and software.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p>
	I have an even logical and creative balance and therefore I can easily
	imagine and envision a project or task aswell as using the logical and
	practical thinking on order to achieve the vision or task at hand. I have
	taken a particular liking to business within the tech industry over the 
	years and would like to build my own company from the ground up. I always 
	aim for something out of my comfort zone as it pushes me to succeed more 
	knowing it is a challenge and therefore I give even more dedication and
	comittment to the project or task that I am working on.
	</p>
	<p>
	<br/>
	Overall I believe that whatever you're doing that you love isn't really
	work , it's just fun and something that brings you joy and fulfilment.
	</p>
