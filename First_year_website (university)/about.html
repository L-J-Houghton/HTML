<article>
<p>	I'm not too good at talking about myself but here it goes!<br/> 
	My full name is Luke James Hougthon , I was born on the<br/> 10th of August 1996 
	at Queen Mary's in south east London<br/> where I have lived most of my life. I have 
	also lived in Kent<br/> during my childhood and still occasionally visit family there.<br/>
	I currently am studying a Bsc undergraduate degree in <br/>Computer Science (CS) at
	Goldsmiths university of London. <br/>I also work part time on weekend night shifts 
	where I <br/>basically deal with stock control. <br/><br/>I have always had a passion for technology in
	general <br/>ever since I first used a computer at age 5. I remember <br/>the desktop was this big
	bulky screen with a hardrive <br/>next to it and the first program I used was the old <br/>MS paint 
	program.And I use to sit there for hours just<br/> drawing random stuff. Ever since then I 
	have always <br/>been interested in the way in which technology works.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
	I am also currently working on my start-up idea in my <br/>spare time and would like to pursue that 
	full time as <br/>I have always wanted to go into business especially <br/>the tech industry. The startup at
	the moment is in it's<br/> very early stages but it's making steady progress.
