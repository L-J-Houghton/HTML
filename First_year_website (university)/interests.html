<div id="info_box">
<div id="info_1">
<img id="car" src="interests\sports_cars.jpg "alt="sports car tile image"/>
<p id="car_info">I have always had a passion<br/> for cars especially sports cars.<br/>
				 I am very interested in classical <br/>sports cars as they all have <br/>some
				 kind of a story behind<br/> them. I'd say if I had to pick a <br/>classical car
				 it'd probably have to be<br/> the ac cobra. Mainly due down to the <br/>retro style and specs of the car.</p>
</div>
<div id="info_2">
<img id="arch" src="interests\architecture.jpg"alt="atchitecture tile image"/>
<p id="arch_info">I have a passion and interest in Architecture <br/>as I've always observed the structuring and <br/>style of buildings. I am particulary
				  interested <br/>in Antoni Gaudi's work as the inpressionist <br/>stlye is aesthetically appealing.I am also <br/>into alot of modern
				  styled buildings and <br/>structures that have been designed by <br/>architects such as Frank Gehry, as the use <br/>of geometry also interests me.</p>
</div>
<div id="info_3">
<img id="star" src="interests\star_wars.jpg"alt="star wars tile image"/>
<p id="star_info">Star wars has been an interest of<br/> mine since an early age. I would say<br/> I like the imagination and sci-fi style <br/>that
				  goes into making the films. I don't<br/> really have a favourite although I do<br/> prefer the 2nd trilogy compared to the<br/> 1st.
				  I'd say my favourite character would <br/>have to be yoda or possibly R2-D2.<br/>
				  I also use to collect figurines and <br/>collectables some of which I still have.</p>
</div>
<div id="info_4">
<img id="space" src="interests\space.jpg"alt="space tile image"/>
<p id="space_info">Space has always fascianted me since <br/>an early age. I have a huge interest in <br/>space as much of it is unknown and un-<br/>explored and that
					really makes me<br/> curious and gains my interest. I also <br/>find the structuring of solar systems <br/>fascinating and it really makes me<br/>
					curious as to how these structures <br/>were formed.</p>
</div>
<div id="info_5">
<img id="tech" src="interests\technology.jpg"alt="technology tile image"/>
<p id="tech_info">Technology has been a huge interest <br/>to me for as far as I could remember. I<br/>
				  have a lot of passion for technology<br/> as it's something that has always made<br/> me 
				  curious and willing to learn how<br/> certain types of technologies work <br/>and function.
				  It's one of the reasons <br/>why I am studying a computer science<br/> degree as I'd like to go 
				  within the industry.</p>
</div>
<div id="info_6">
<img id="marvel" src="interests\marvel.jpg"alt="marvel tile image"/>
<p id="marvel_info">I've had an interest for Marvel for quite <br/>a few years. I first got into Marvel when<br/> the Iron man trilogy
					came out. This then<br/> got me interested in other movies <br/>(superheroes) such as Thor , Captain <br/>America and
					a few others. I would not <br/>say I'm a huge fan but It does really <br/>appeal to me.</p>
</div>
<div id="info_7">
<img id="books" src="interests\books.jpg"alt="books tile image"/>
<p id="books_info">I have always been interested in <br/>reading and books in general. I am <br/>mainly into non-fiction however I do <br/>
				   like certain fictional books such as <br/>"The Great Gatsby" and The Harry<br/> Potter saga. I mainly like
				   non-fiction <br/>as I like reading about facts and <br/>learning more about the world.</p>
</div>
<div id="info_8">
<img id="museums" src="interests\museums.jpg"alt="museums tile image"/>
<p id="museums_info">Museums and galleries have always <br/>been an interest of mine as I like<br/> learning new things not only just 
					 reading<br/>about artifacts and artworks but actually<br/> viewing them and learning more behind <br/>the history
					 behind the artwork or <br/>the historical artifact.</p>
</div>
<div id="info_9">
<img id="music" src="interests\music.jpg"alt="music image tile"/>
<p id="music_info">I have a passion for music as I believe music <br/>plays a huge parts of our lives. I don't really <br/>have a certain taste
				   when it comes to music <br/>as the genre or style of music depends on<br/> the mood I'm in. I do however have a particular<br/>
				   liking to instrumental music especially classical music as I use classical music to relax and to concentrate when 
				   I'm working.</p>
